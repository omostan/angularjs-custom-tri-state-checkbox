# angularjs-custom-tri-state-checkbox
AngularJS Tri-State Checkbox directive originally developed by [Stephen Long](https://github.com/long2know/angular-directives-general) for his blog. Due to the fact that I have made several changes to the directive and my recent decision to move to the new Angular 8, I have decided to move this custom version of the original to npm repository.
